# Financial Modeling Definitions & Formulas

## Income Statement (P&L) Components

### Revenue
**Definition**: Total sales from goods/services before any expenses.
- Growing company metric
- Always appears at top of P&L
- Basis for all other calculations

### Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
**Definition**: Direct costs to produce goods/services (materials, labor, manufacturing).
**Formula**: COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory
- Variable with production volume
- Typically 30-70% of revenue depending on industry
- Key to Gross Profit calculation

### Gross Profit
**Definition**: Revenue minus COGS.
**Formula**: Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS
**Metric**: Gross Margin % = Gross Profit / Revenue
- Shows profitability at product level
- Higher is better (60%+ is strong)

### Operating Expenses (OpEx)
**Definition**: Costs to run business (R&D, sales, admin).
**Includes**:
- Sales & Marketing (S&M)
- Research & Development (R&D)
- General & Administrative (G&A)
- Depreciation & Amortization (D&A)

**Formula**: OpEx = S&M + R&D + G&A + D&A

### EBITDA
**Definition**: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.
**Formula**: EBITDA = Revenue - COGS - OpEx (before D&A)
- Approximates operating cash generation
- Key valuation metric for M&A
- Removes non-cash items and financing decisions

**Metric**: EBITDA Margin % = EBITDA / Revenue
- Industry benchmark varies: 10-40% typical
- Higher margin = better operational efficiency

### EBIT (Operating Income)
**Definition**: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes.
**Formula**: EBIT = EBITDA - D&A
- True operating profit
- Reflects all operating decisions

### Net Income
**Definition**: Bottom line profit after all expenses, interest, and taxes.
**Formula**: Net Income = EBIT - Interest Expense - Taxes
**Metric**: Net Margin % = Net Income / Revenue
- True profitability available to equity holders
- Affected by leverage and tax strategy

## Cash Flow Components

### Operating Cash Flow (OCF)
**Definition**: Cash generated from core business operations.
**Simplified Formula**: OCF = Net Income + D&A - Change in NWC
- Most important indicator of business health
- Should be monitored vs Net Income
- Watch for divergence (sign of quality issues)

### Free Cash Flow (FCF)
**Definition**: Cash available to all investors after capex.
**Formula**: FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures
**Alternative**: FCF = EBIT × (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in NWC
- Key input for valuation
- Must be positive for sustainable business
- Growing FCF is best scenario

### Capital Expenditures (CapEx)
**Definition**: Cash spent on fixed assets (PP&E).
**Formula**: CapEx = Maintenance CapEx + Growth CapEx
- Maintenance CapEx: Keep business running
- Growth CapEx: Expand capacity
- Varies by industry: 2-5% of revenue typical

### Change in Net Working Capital (NWC)
**Definition**: Change in current assets minus current liabilities.
**Calculation**: Δ NWC = (Current Assets - Cash) - (Current Liabilities - Debt)
**Key Components**:
- Accounts Receivable (AR): Money owed by customers
- Inventory: Products held
- Accounts Payable (AP): Money owed to suppliers
- Accrued Expenses: Expenses incurred but not paid

**Impact**: Increase in NWC is cash outflow; decrease is inflow

## Balance Sheet Components

### Current Assets
- **Cash & Equivalents**: Most liquid asset
- **Accounts Receivable**: Money owed by customers
- **Inventory**: Products held for sale
- **Other Current Assets**: Prepaid expenses, deposits

### Fixed Assets
- **Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E)**: Long-term tangible assets
- **Depreciation**: Allocation of PP&E cost over useful life
- **Net PP&E**: Gross PP&E minus accumulated depreciation
- **Intangibles**: Patents, goodwill, trademarks

### Current Liabilities
- **Accounts Payable**: Money owed to suppliers
- **Short-term Debt**: Debt due within 12 months
- **Accrued Expenses**: Expenses incurred but not yet paid
- **Other Current Liabilities**: Deferred revenue, current portion of long-term debt

### Long-term Liabilities
- **Long-term Debt**: Debt due beyond 12 months
- **Other LT Liabilities**: Deferred taxes, pension obligations

### Stockholders' Equity
- **Common Stock**: Par value of shares issued
- **Additional Paid-in Capital**: Premium paid above par
- **Retained Earnings**: Accumulated profits not distributed
- **Treasury Stock**: Repurchased shares

## Key Ratios & Metrics

### Profitability Ratios
- **Gross Margin**: Gross Profit / Revenue (production efficiency)
- **Operating Margin**: EBIT / Revenue (operational efficiency)
- **Net Margin**: Net Income / Revenue (overall profitability)
- **EBITDA Margin**: EBITDA / Revenue (operational cash generation)
- **Return on Assets (ROA)**: Net Income / Total Assets
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Net Income / Stockholders' Equity

### Efficiency Ratios
- **Asset Turnover**: Revenue / Total Assets (how efficiently assets generate sales)
- **Receivables Turnover**: Revenue / AR (how quickly customers pay)
- **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)**: 365 / Receivables Turnover
- **Inventory Turnover**: COGS / Inventory
- **Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)**: 365 / Inventory Turnover

### Liquidity Ratios
- **Current Ratio**: Current Assets / Current Liabilities (ability to pay ST obligations)
- **Quick Ratio**: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
- **Cash Ratio**: Cash / Current Liabilities

### Leverage Ratios
- **Debt-to-Equity**: Total Debt / Total Equity
- **Debt-to-Assets**: Total Debt / Total Assets
- **Equity Multiplier**: Total Assets / Total Equity
- **Interest Coverage**: EBIT / Interest Expense (ability to cover debt service)

### Valuation Multiples
- **Enterprise Value (EV)**: Market Cap + Debt - Cash
- **EV/Revenue**: EV / Annual Revenue
- **EV/EBITDA**: EV / Annual EBITDA
- **Price/Earnings (P/E)**: Market Cap / Net Income

## Cost of Capital

### Risk-Free Rate
**Definition**: Return on government bonds with no default risk.
- Typically 10-year Treasury rate
- Currently: 3-5% (varies with interest rates)

### Beta
**Definition**: Measure of systematic risk relative to market.
- Beta = 1: Moves with market
- Beta > 1: More volatile than market
- Beta < 1: Less volatile than market
- Tech: 1.2-1.5; Utilities: 0.7-0.9

### Market Risk Premium
**Definition**: Expected return above risk-free rate for equity market.
- Long-term historical: 5-7%
- Used in CAPM calculation

### Cost of Equity (CAPM)
**Formula**: Re = Rf + β(Rm - Rf)
- Rf = Risk-free rate
- β = Beta
- (Rm - Rf) = Market risk premium
- Typical range: 8-15%

### Cost of Debt
**Definition**: Interest rate company pays on debt.
- Based on credit rating
- Current market conditions
- Maturity structure
- Typical range: 2-10%

### Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
**Formula**: WACC = (E/V × Re) + (D/V × Rd × (1 - Tc))

- D/V: Debt weight
- Re: Cost of equity
- Rd: Cost of debt
- Tc: Tax rate
- Typical range: 5-12%

## Growth Metrics

### Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
**Formula**: CAGR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/# Years) - 1
**Usage**: Normalize growth across different time periods

### Retention Rate
**Formula**: Retention Rate = 1 - Dividend Payout Ratio
**Usage**: How much earnings reinvested vs distributed

### Sustainable Growth Rate
**Formula**: Sustainable Growth Rate = ROE × Retention Rate
**Usage**: Maximum growth rate achievable without external financing

## Unit Economics (SaaS/Subscription)

### Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
**Definition**: Revenue from subscriptions annualized.
**Formula**: ARR = Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) × 12

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
**Definition**: Cost to acquire one customer.
**Formula**: CAC = Sales & Marketing Expense / New Customers Acquired

### CAC Payback Period
**Definition**: Months to recover customer acquisition cost.
**Formula**: CAC Payback = CAC / Monthly Gross Profit per Customer
**Target**: < 12 months (ideally < 9 months)

### Lifetime Value (LTV)
**Definition**: Total profit expected from a customer.
**Formula**: LTV = ARPU × Gross Margin % × Customer Lifetime (years)
- ARPU = Average Revenue Per User

### LTV/CAC Ratio
**Definition**: Payback efficiency metric.
**Formula**: LTV / CAC
**Target**: > 3:1 (at least 3x return on CAC)

### Churn Rate
**Definition**: Percentage of customers lost per period.
- Monthly Churn: % of customers lost per month
- Annual Churn = (1 - (1 - Monthly Churn)^12)
**Formula**: Churn Rate = Customers Lost / Beginning Customers

### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)
**Definition**: Revenue from existing customers after churn and expansion.
**Formula**: NRR = (Beginning ARR + Expansion - Churn) / Beginning ARR
**Target**: > 100% indicates growth beyond new customer acquisition
